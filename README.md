A mc server hosting panel made by me its soo so so simple
to run it (and pull it. It uses python flask, java (ofc) and docker and no hasty things about users, database and etc. just straight to the point)
  
```
docker run -d \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -p 8081:8081 \
  -p 25565:25565 \
  -p 25577:25577 \
  -v /home/yoiwannajinksbegam/server:/app/server \
  -v /home/yoiwannajinksbegam/bungee:/app/bungee \
  -v /home/yoiwannajinksbegam/server.sh:/app/server.sh \
  -v /home/yoiwannajinksbegam/bungee.sh:/app/bungee.sh \
  --name kukur-panel-container \
  anikthedev/kukur-panel:v1.2.2
```
replace the ```/home/yoiwannajinks/<directory>``` with your files okay?
anyway  if your not using bungee then dont put (for servers that are made for a small groups of friends)
plus the port 8080 is for the panel and port 8081 is for eaglercraft (yes i sometimes play java plus eagler) and 25565 is server and 25577 is bungee
make a start.sh using 
```
#!/bin/bash
cd /app/server
java -Xmx1G -Xms1G -jar server.jar nogui

```
bungee.sh using
```
#!/bin/bash
cd /app/bungee
java -Xmx512M -Xms512M -jar bungee.jar nogui

```
and is your using google cloud and put it in the root directory 
then do this for putting the sh directories
```
/home/<GMAIL-ACC>/start.sh
/home/<GMAIL-ACC>/bungee.sh
```
then open port 8080
and do start server
and go back on the page and see logs
and i will never add commands support since you should run the server normally onece and op your self
